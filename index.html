			<p>Founded in 2010 by Daniel Matishak, Mindable is one of the most exciting digital publishing companies in personal transformation.</p>

			<p>Mindable invested in an idea we were passionate about and grew from a basement operation, to being ranked one of the top 2,000 websites in the world (Alexa.com). Mindable was voted as one of the fastest growing tech companies in 2015 (Deloitte), coming in at #14 of the Top 50 in Canada, and #122 of the Top 500 in North America!</p>

			<p>Over the years Mindable has had the opportunity to tap into some of the most interesting markets and as we have mentioned, we’ve found our success and passion publishing authors, articles and products in the self-discovery and personal transformation space. This massive market grants Mindable a digital playground to publish content, test new ideas and connect with a valuable network of unique individuals.</p>

												<p>Each of Mindable’s members joined the team wanting more; to put their stamp on something they believe in, to make an impact. This level of passion has become part of our everyday life, and with that, what was once seemingly impossible, starts to shift. Our belief is that there is no such thing as “it can’t be done”, instead, it is always just a matter of “how can we make it happen!”.</p>
